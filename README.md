# Sentiment-analysis

## Idea: Create an API that allows the upload of audio files, these audio files are then transcribed and sentiment analysis is then performed on them and reports are generated.
### Tasks
- [x] Allow the upload of audio files
- [x] Add a transcriber to accurately transcribe the uploaded audio
- [x] Save the audio to a temporary file
- [ ] Create or obtain a model that can perform sentiment analysis on the transcribed audio
- [ ] Generate a file for the result of the sentiment analysis and return it in the API response

## NB: This project is still a work in progress :relaxed:
